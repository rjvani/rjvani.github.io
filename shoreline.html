        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          I implemented a framework that parallelizes adaptive
          boosting with user-made classifiers using the CUDA framework.
        </p>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          Adaptive Boosting, or AdaBoost, is a machine learning meta-algorithm
          that is used to progressively build a strong classifier as a
          linear-weighted combination of weak classifiers.
        </p>
        <p>
          A lot of traditional machine learning problems suffer from a loss
          in predictive power as dimensionality increases. Samples that
          algorithms process can have an unknown number of features. These
          features may be irrelevant or even slow down execution times, so
          AdaBoost focuses on extracting the important features that help
          a model's predictive power.
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, a boosting's weighting can be expressed as follows
        </p>
        <p><img src="assets/img/boost_weight.svg"></p>
        <p>
          Each weak learner takes some object and classifies it. With each
          added learner, all the learners have some predicted classification
          for each data point in the training set. Each weak learner is
          assigned some weighting to boost each learner's contribution.
          This is generally expressed as follows
        </p>
        <p><img src="assets/img/weak_learners.svg"></p>
        <p>
          This algorithm is highly parallelizeable since each data point's
          weight is independent of everything else in the set and each
          weak learner is independent of each other. As discussed further
          below, the CUDA framework was used to take advantage of this.
        </p>
        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <h4>Software Design</h4>
        <p>
          Since I wanted to build a library for adaptive boosting, I wanted
          to allow users to input their own sets of training data and define
          their own custom classifiers. So, the main implementation consists
          of a C++ class which is constructed with data objects and has
          methods to add classifiers and print evaluation data.
        </p>
        <h4>Work Distribution</h4>
        <p>
          The parallelization from this problem comes from the fact that
          the final weights of data points are orthogonal from each other and
          classifiers are independent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first approach with the CUDA framework included exposing a
          single function to sequentially add rule classifier functions. After
          a user did this, corresponding CUDA blocks and threads were
          spawned to parallelize weak classification across each data point.
          There was some speedup noticed with this implementation, but
          nothing significant.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next approach including refactoring the API call to take in
          multiple function calls. This way, blocks can be used to
          parallelize work across each classifier to find corresponding weights
          independently. Shared variables were also used to help aggregate
          these weight coefficients.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also realized I had a bunch of unnecessary synchronization
          barriers. Removing unnecessary calls to __syncthreads() and
          cudaDeviceSynchronize() increased speedup an incredible amount.
        </p>
        <h4>Further Optimizations</h4>
        <p>
          If I had more time on this project, I would try to optimize the
          bottlenecks in my current implementation. After profiling my code,
          I realized that most of the run-time was being spent in allocating
          memory; a lot of the time was spent in cudaMalloc, cudaMemcpy, and
          cudaFree.
        </p>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <img src="assets/img/speedup.png">
        <p>
          The above plot demonstrates speedup with varying number of weak
          learners and different lengths of data sets. Data sets of different
          lengths were generated with randomly using Python scripts.
        </p>
        <h3 id="checkpoint">Checkpoint (4/25)</h3>
        <p>
          So far, I've been on track with my schedule. I have a sequential
          implementation of adaptive boosting done with basic classifiers. I'm
          working on adding another classifier before I begin to use CUDA to
          parallelize each classifier.

          The main thing that I want to demo at the competition is mainly
          speedup plots -- I'll be having graph that shows speedup achieved
          from parallelizing running different classifiers in parallel. I
          don't have any preliminary results yet since I'm still finishing
          up my classifiers and haven't implemented the parallel version yet.
        </p>
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          The main challenge behind this project is AdaBoost itself. This
          algorithm is generalizable to different learning models (i.e. the
          weak classifiers). On top of achieving parallel speed-up, there
          will need to be back-testing done for various combinations of
          classifiers and tuning performance of how the framework updates.

          Additionally, this project will aim to minimize overfitting in
          the presence of noise.
        </p>
        <h3>Resources</h3>
        <p>
          No starter files will be used for this project. Everything will
          be coded from scratch.

          In terms of literature, I have no experience with implementing
          Machine Learning algorithms or knowledge of common classifiers, so
          I will be using a few papers to ramp up.
        </p>
        <h3>Platform</h3>
        <p>
          I'm choosing to use CUDA because a main component of this project is
          abstracting a good way to manage a set of weak classifiers. CUDA
          offers a simple and easy interface (of kernels) and management
          of GPU threads to help parallelize each update cycle in this
          algorithm.
        </p>
        <h3>Proposed Schedule</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>(4/18) Set up code-base with sequential implementation of one weak classifier.</li>
          <li>(4/25) Implement at least two classifiers working in parallel.</li>
          <li>(5/5)  Increase set of classifiers and collect performance data for benchmarking.</li>
          <li>(5/10) Create API to use system.</li>
          <li>(5/12) Finish up!</li>
        </ul>
